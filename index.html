                    <p class="text-muted text-left">The first and simplest task of Sunday school is/ to teach the Bible to our children. We learn about God’s love as we hear its stories and parables. When most people are asked, “What is the most important thing children learn in Sunday school?” the answer is often “the Bible.” In Sunday school, children develop a Christian understanding of the purposes of Scripture. Through these experiences with the Bible in Sunday school, they learn to recognize God’s call to them.</p>

                    <p> Essay on Inter School Competition: Inter-school competitions are held on various topics, throughout the year involving several schools. This is a very healthy thing as a student is assessed, not only within the school, but is compared with the students of all the other schools too. These competitions give the younger generation a boost and raise their confidence while progressively developing a positive attitude towards competitions.</p>
